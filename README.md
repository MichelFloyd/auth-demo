# Apollo Authentication Demo
This demo illustrates how to authenticate an application using Apollo client against a server running Apollo server **version 4**.

This monorepo includes both the [server](./server) and React Native [client](./reactNativeClient/) code.

Both client and server code use TypeScript.

The code is mostly the Apollo demo code with authentication added.
